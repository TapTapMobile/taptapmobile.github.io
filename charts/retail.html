	<h1>3 Steps to replicate Amazon’s 97.5% Organic-traffic</h1>
	<p class="lead">Yes, you read right: Amazon generates 97.5% of its traffic organically. They are not in the business of making Google rich. They are in the business of making Amazon rich.
	<br>
	And here’s how they do it.
	</p>
      <div class="jumbotron">

        <p class="lead">Amazon’s Affiliate program rages on. The chart above shows the up-trending amount of ‘referrers”, aka Affiliate websites. <h6> Data courtesy of SimilarWeb.com</h6></p>
      </div>
	<h1>Amazon’s on-going strategy:</h1>
	  <p>It’s no secret that Amazon’s affiliate programme is huge. Last stats released state that they have over 2 million affiliates. Although the program has had a lot of criticism, and discussions on some super-affiliate forums have long since declared the program as “not worth it”, Amazon nevertheless is constantly adding to the organic-traffic machine.</p>

      </div>  
	  <p>Amazon has only one main competitor with a similar strategy: ebay. The three other big players: Target, BestBuy & WalMart are not following suit, even though they very easily could.</p>
	<h1>Cutting Waste:</h1>  
	  <div class="jumbotron">
        <img src="img/similar/Display_Ads.jpg" class="img-responsive img-thumbnail"></a>
        <p class="lead">Not satisfied with paying for only 2.5% ad-traffic, 
Amazon actively seeks to decrease its ad-spend. <h6> Data courtesy of SimilarWeb.com</h6></p>
      </div> 
	  <h1>Amazon.com Organic Traffic breakdown:</h1>
	  <p>Their strategy can roughly be summed up in three steps:</p>
		<ol>
		<li><p>Get Affiliates to send you prospects,</p></li>
		<li><p>Create consumer-content, eg: imdb.com is a “public service” website feeding popular  celebrity frenzy,</p></li>
		<li><p>Generate Controversy: press coverage from the Nevada Sales Tax,  and the recent EU’s legislature only goes to remind people that Amazon is the place for bargain shopping.</p></li>
		</ol>
	<h4>Specifically, this breaks down as:</h4>

	  	<h3> <span class="label label-primary">45.41% Direct:</span></h3>
        <div class="col-lg-6">
          <h4>What Amazon is doing: </h4>
          <p>this literally means 45% of the x-millions are tyoning in “amazon.com” into their browser.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="col-lg-6">
          <h4>Your Opportunity:</h4>
          <p>It’s not so easy to achieve such branding if you’re a new the new e-commerce site. However, controversial news, or press-releases will get you press attention. And they are not so hard to concoct. Sites like HARO & SourceBottle will help you connect to journo’s constantly looking for a scoop.</p>

	  	<h3> <span class="label label-danger">25.12% Search:</span></h3>
        <div class="col-lg-6">
          <h4>What Amazon is doing: </h4>
          <p>Amazon have excellent image indexing. Think of the amount of times you looked for a product image and found the image that Google returns actually originated from Amazon.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="col-lg-6">
          <h4>Your Opportunity:</h4>
          <p>a) This is just SEO grunt-work. Retail sites SEO is very well covered here, including details of URL structure and categorisation. And properly labeling your images with an alt tag, hosting them properly so they are always available just takes work. You can submit your products to the Google Merchant Center, which now offers to collect your data using a variety of feeds. Even via spreadsheet.</p>
		<p>b) piggybacking: If you are not selling via Amazon’s marketplace, then it is worth considering. They already have huge volume, and there ways to rank your products higher in their search engine. Again this will take SEO grunt work, from image tags to product description to price comparisons.</p>

          <h4>What Amazon is doing: </h4>
          <p>Amazon has built up a staggering amount of affiliates: 2,759 websites sending them approx 1.5 Billion visits/year.</p>
		  <p>The main strategy here is providing them with vouchers and coupons. Although it isn’t the only strategy, as IMDB.com is a site completely built an dmaintained by Amazon as one huge store flag.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="col-lg-6">
          <h4>Your Opportunity:</h4>
          <p>Approach the same affiliates. For example, Amazon’s biggest single affiliate Slickdeals.net can be approached. So can Nextag, which sends approx 10.2M visits per year to Amazon. Gawker media is another huge contributor, who can be reached here</p>
